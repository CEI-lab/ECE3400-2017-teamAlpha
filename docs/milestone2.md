# Milestone 2: Treasure Detection
## Team Alpha

### Treasure detection
We were able to use our FFT results from lab 2 to help us detect treasures with four different frequencies. We obtained the following graph from lab 2:

The graph also shows the FFT results for 5 different frequencies, ranging from 7kHz to 17kHz. Using this data, we were able to determine the treasure frequencies based on where the peaks for each frequency occured. 

The table below shows the bin numbers that the biggest peak occurs in for each frequency in a more readable format.
